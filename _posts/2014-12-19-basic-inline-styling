Styling tags or divs
--------------------

Presto is a CMS that requires a fair deal of coaxing to get things to work properly. It doesn't always like to render things properly, and because every website has its own idiosyncracies, when we embed objects or make tweaks - things rarely look the way they should.

So a large part of our job is to tweak things to look "OK" and that requires playing around with <b>Attributes</b> and <i>Values</i>.

If you scroll back up, you'll see that <b>Attributes</b> are the ones highlighted in green, whereas <i>Values</i> are in red.

Even when you move beyond HTML and venture in Javascript or CSS or other more complicated web languages, you'll notice the same logic applies there as well. There will be attributes, and there will be values, and together they make wonderful web babies that we devour with our eyes.
